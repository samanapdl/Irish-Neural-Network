Load the Iris data

Break data set into two parts: training and testing.

Modify the ANN architecture, learning rate, and momentum parameters until you find a combination that you feel provides the best performance ON THE TRAINING DATA SET. 

Compute the classification accuracy using the trained neural network on both the training and test sets

For each training epoch in the supplied code, store the MSE loss for both the training and test data.

For each training epoch in the supplied code, store the classification accuracy for both the training and test data.

plot: 1) training and test MSE loss values for each epoch and 2) the training and test classification accuracy.
